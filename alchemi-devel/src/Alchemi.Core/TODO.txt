Overall
=======
[ ] Make private variables start with _ or m_?
[ ] Look into changing all "String" types to "string"
[ ] Look into changing all "Int32" types to "int"
[ ] Why do some of the *View storage classes have a StateString property?  Is there a better way?

Delegates
===
[ ] Change the delegates (GApplicationFinish, GThreadFinish, and GThreadFailed) 
    so that they have "object sender" and are also named properly

ApplicationStorageView
====
[ ] Should c_noDateTime be static or const?

PermissionStorageView
===
[ ] Change GetPermissionStorageView so it doesn't use an ArrayList

StorageMaintenanceParameters
===
[ ] Add documentation
[ ] Change ArrayList stuff

EmbeddedFileDependency
===
[ ] Change the ArrayLists to use generics

FileDependencyCollection
===
[ ] Derive from the generic ReadOnlyCollection<FileDependency> to fully embrace .NET 2.0 generics
[ ] Can also take advantage of List.Contains()

GApplication
===
[ ] Create an OnApplicationFinish method that fires the event
[ ] Add blocking Start() method. 
    That is, a call to Start() doesn't return until the entire GApplication is finished.

GConnection
===
[ ] FromConsole method needs some error checking (like for the int.Parse method)

GConnectionDialogForm
===
[ ] Show error messages on a label on the form instead of using a MessageBox
[ ] ReadConfig always gets the file from the same location.  Make this configurable?

GConnectionDialogFormConfig
===
[ ] Move into the Owner namespace?

GThread
===
[ ] Change the SetFailed, SetWorkingDirectory, SetApplication, and SetId methods to properties

GThreadBuffer
===
[ ] Can m_cThreads be moved from an ArrayList to a List<>?
[ ] Get rid of the Hungarian notation?

ThreadCollection
===
[ ] Rewrite this using List<GThread>
